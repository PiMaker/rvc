# rvc - risc v in c

An experimental RISC-V emulator written in plain C [0], with a focus on porting the result to a HLSL pixel shader.

[0] The elf loader ('elfy') is written in Rust, because I was too lazy to do it myself in C (Rust uses the 'elf' crate) and it doesn't need porting anyway.

# Why?

Because.
