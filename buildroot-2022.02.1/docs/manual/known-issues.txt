== Known issues

* It is not possible to pass extra linker options via +BR2_TARGET_LDFLAGS+
  if such options contain a +$+ sign. For example, the following is known
  to break: +BR2_TARGET_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=\'$ORIGIN/../lib'"+

* The +libffi+ package is not supported on the SuperH 2, nds32, and ARMv7-M
  architectures.

* The +prboom+ package triggers a compiler failure with the SuperH 4
  compiler from Sourcery CodeBench, version 2012.09.
