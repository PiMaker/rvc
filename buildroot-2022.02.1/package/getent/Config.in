config BR2_PACKAGE_GETENT
	bool "getent"
	help
	  This package installs the 'getent' utility, which allows to
	  get entries from Name Service Switch libraries. For glibc
	  toolchains, it's the real getent program from the C library
	  that gets installed, which is NSS-capable. For uclibc and
	  musl toolchains, it's a simple wrapper script that emulates
	  getent's behavior, since there is no NSS support in uclibc
	  and musl.
