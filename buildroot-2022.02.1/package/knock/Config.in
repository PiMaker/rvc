	  A port knocking implementation.
	  Provides a daemon and a user application. Port knocking can be
	  used to run an arbitrary application, once the daemon detects
	  a predefined sequence of incoming TCP/UDP packets on a network
	  interface. This can be used, e.g. to open up ports in a
	  firewall.
