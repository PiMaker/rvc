	  Firmware utils are tools that can be used for managing
	  platform / device / vendor specific firmware images. Depending
	  on a specific tool it may be possible to read information,
	  extract data, modify or build an image from a scratch.

	  A common host usage of firmware utils is to build a bootloader
	  supported image.
