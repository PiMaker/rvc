	  Firmware utils are tools that can be used for managing
	  platform / device / vendor specific firmware images. Depending
	  on a specific tool it may be possible to read information,
	  extract data, modify or build an image from a scratch.

	  A common target usage of firmware utils is to upgrade kernel
	  and / or rootfs. Depending on device it may be required to
	  extract a part of firmware image and flash it.
