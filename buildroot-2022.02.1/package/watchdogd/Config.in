	  Extended version of uClinux-dist watchdogd.  Monitors loadavg,
	  file descriptors and memory leaks, and capable of supervising
	  your processes main loop using an instrumentation API.

	  A reset reason is saved for power loss, CPU overload, or any
	  of the monitored conditions (above).	The full capabilities
	  are limited by the kernel watchdog driver, but even the basic
	  "softdog" driver is supported.  See /etc/watchdogd.conf for
	  details, and try watchdogctl for system status and available
	  commands.
