	  There are many types and causes of latency. LatencyTOP
	  focuses on the type of latency that causes skips in audio,
	  stutters in your desktop experience or that overloads your
	  server (while you have plenty of CPU power left).

	  LatencyTOP focuses on the cases where the applications want
	  to run and execute useful code, but there's some resource
	  that's not currently available (and the kernel then blocks
	  the process). This is done both on a system level and on a
	  per process level, so that you can see what's happening to
	  the system, and which process is suffering and/or causing
	  the delays.
