	  Alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary
	  local information over the mesh/network in a decentralized
	  fashion.

	  This data can be anything which appears to be useful -
	  originally designed to replace the batman-adv visualization
	  (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books,
	  administration information, DNS information, the local
	  weather forecast ...
