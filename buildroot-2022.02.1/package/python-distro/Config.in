	  distro provides information about the OS distribution it
	  runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or version
	  information.

	  It is the recommended replacement for Python's original
	  platform.linux_distribution function (removed in Python
	  3.8). It also provides much more functionality which isn't
	  necessarily Python bound, like a command-line interface.
