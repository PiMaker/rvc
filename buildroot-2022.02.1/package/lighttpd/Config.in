	  lighttpd a secure, fast, compliant and very flexible
	  web-server which has been optimized for high-performance
	  environments. It has a very low memory footprint compared to
	  other webservers and takes care of cpu-load. Its advanced
	  feature-set (FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression,
	  URL-Rewriting and many more) make lighttpd the perfect
	  webserver-software for every server that is suffering load
	  problems.
