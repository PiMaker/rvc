	  GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find
	  geographical and network information of an IP address.

	  To use this library, you need to download MaxMind's free
	  GeoLite or commercial GeoIP binary databases into the
	  target's /usr/share/GeoIP directory in uncompressed form.

	  Note that GeoIP2 / GeoLite2 are not supported by this
	  library.
