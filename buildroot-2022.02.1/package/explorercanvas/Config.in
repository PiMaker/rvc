	  Modern browsers like Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera
	  support the HTML5 canvas tag to allow 2D command-based
	  drawing. ExplorerCanvas brings the same functionality to
	  Internet Explorer (<v9). To use, web developers only need to
	  include a single script tag in their existing web pages.
