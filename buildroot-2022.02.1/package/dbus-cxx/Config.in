	  DBus-cxx is a C++ implementation for DBus. DBus is a
	  Linux-specific RPC (remote procedure call) and
	  IPC (inter-process communications) mechanism.
	  DBus-cxx provides an object-oriented view of all programs
	  on the DBus, and allows an object-oriented way of
	  exporting methods onto the DBus.
