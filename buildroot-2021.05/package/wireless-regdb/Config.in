	  Wireless regulatory database.

	  Wireless regulatory database. The database lists the
	  allowed radio frequencies for each local jurisdiction.

	  Since linux-4.15 the kernel supports loading the files
	  regulatory.db/regulatory.db.p7s directly from the
	  /lib/firmware directory, for earlier versions the crda helper
	  application is needed.
