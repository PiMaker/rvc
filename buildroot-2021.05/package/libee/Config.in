	  An Event Expression Library inspired by CEE.

	  CEE is an upcoming standard used to describe network
	  events in a number of normalized formats. It's goal is
	  to unify they currently many different representations
	  that exist in the industry.

	  The core idea of libee is to provide a small but hopefully
	  convenient API layer above the CEE standard. However, CEE
	  is not finished. At the time of this writing, CEE is under
	  heavy development and even some of its core data structures
	  (like the data dictionary and taxonmy) have not been fully
	  specified.
