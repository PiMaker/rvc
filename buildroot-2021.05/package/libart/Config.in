	  Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics. It
	  supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the same
	  as SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all PostScript
	  imaging operations, and adds antialiasing and
	  alpha-transparency. It is also highly tuned for incremental
	  rendering. It contains data structures and algorithms suited
	  to rapid, precise computation of Region of Interest, and a
	  two-phase rendering pipeline optimized for interactive
	  display.
