	  SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several
	  popular sound file formats, such as .WAV and .MP3.
	  It is meant to make the programmer's sound playback tasks
	  simpler. The programmer gives SDL_sound a filename, or feeds
	  it data directly from one of many sources, and then reads the
	  decoded waveform data back at her leisure.
