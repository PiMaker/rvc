	  Build a cloop root filesystem

	  cloop is a Linux kernel module that enables compressed
	  loopback filesystem support. With it you can mount a
	  compressed filesystem like a block device and seamlessly
	  decompress its data while accessing it.  The majority of the
	  software on an LNX-BBC is accessed in this fashion.
